    <p style="color: white ; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Earth is the only known planet to sustain life, being the third planet from the Sun and a unique world of land, water, and air that provides essential resources for survival, though it faces threats from human activities like pollution and deforestation. Our planet is a dynamic sphere covered mostly by water, protected by an atmosphere, and home to diverse ecosystems, but its delicate balance is disrupted by resource exploitation, leading to increased global warming and environmental degradation. Therefore, preserving Earth through responsible resource use, planting trees, and reducing pollution is crucial for the well-being of all life and future generations.  </p>

    <p style="color: white ; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant known for its massive size, strong magnetic field, and iconic Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for centuries. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a dense core surrounded by layers of metallic hydrogen and molecular hydrogen. Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The planet's rapid rotation causes it to have a noticeable oblate shape, and its powerful gravitational influence affects the orbits of other objects in the solar system. Jupiter plays a crucial role in protecting the inner planets from potential comet and asteroid impacts due to its strong gravitational pull.  </p>

    <a style="align-self: center;" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SolarFull_SeanDoran_2880FullwidthLede.jpg" alt="sun" style="width:35%" height="45%" ></a>
    <p style="color: white ; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">The Sun is a massive, glowing sphere of hot plasma at the center of our solar system, providing the essential energy that sustains life on Earth through its light and heat. Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, the Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process. This energy travels outward through the Sun's layers and eventually reaches Earth as sunlight. The Sun's gravitational pull keeps the planets, asteroids, and comets in orbit around it, maintaining the structure of the solar system. It has an 11-year cycle of solar activity, including sunspots and solar flares, which can impact space weather and communication systems on Earth. The Sun is expected to continue shining for another 5 billion years before evolving into a red giant and eventually a white dwarf.  </p>

    <a style="align-self: center;" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/330px-FullMoon2010.jpg" alt="moon" style="width: 25%" height="45%" ></a>
    <p style="color: white ; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, orbiting our planet at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles). It is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system and the largest relative to the size of its host planet. The Moon's surface is covered with craters, mountains, and plains, formed by ancient volcanic activity and impacts from asteroids and comets. It has a synchronous rotation, meaning the same side always faces Earth, known as the near side, while the far side remains hidden from view. The Moon plays a crucial role in influencing Earth's tides due to its gravitational pull. It has been a subject of human fascination

    <p style="color: white ; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our solar system, renowned for its stunning ring system composed of ice and rock particles. It is a gas giant primarily made of hydrogen and helium, with a small rocky core surrounded by layers of metallic hydrogen and molecular hydrogen. Saturn has at least 83 moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system, which has a thick atmosphere and liquid hydrocarbon lakes. The planet's rapid rotation causes it to have an oblate shape, with a noticeable bulge at its equator. Saturn's rings are divided into several sections, with gaps created by the gravitational influence of its moons. The planet's atmosphere features strong winds and storms, including the long-lasting hexagonal storm at its north pole. Saturn plays a significant role in our understanding of planetary formation and dynamics within the solar system.  </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; font-weight: 300; color: white;"> Mercury</h3>
    <a style="align-self: center;" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"> <img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/C454F5A6-536E-4C9F-AA6AF354BB85A85B_source.jpg?w=1200" alt="mars" style="width: 25%" height="45%" ></a>
    <p style="color: white ; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting closest to the Sun. It has a rocky surface covered with craters, similar to Earth's Moon, and experiences extreme temperature variations due to its lack of a significant atmosphere. During the day, temperatures can soar up to 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit), while at night, they can plummet to -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit). Mercury has a very thin atmosphere composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. The planet has a unique 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, meaning it rotates three times on its axis for every two orbits around the Sun. Mercury's surface features include large impact basins, cliffs, and plains formed by volcanic activity. Due to its proximity to the Sun, observing Mercury from Earth can be challenging, as it is often lost in the Sun's glare.  </p>

    <p style="color: white ; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. However, Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures reaching up to 465 degrees Celsius (869 degrees Fahrenheit). The planet's surface is covered with volcanic plains, mountains, and large impact craters. Venus has a very slow rotation, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, and it rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in the solar system. This means that on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. The planet's dense atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect, trapping heat and making it inhospitable for life as we know it. Despite its harsh conditions, Venus has been a subject of fascination and study for astronomers and planetary scientists.  </p>

    <p style="color: white ; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, known for its striking blue color caused by the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and traces of other gases, with a small rocky core surrounded by layers of icy materials. Neptune has a dynamic atmosphere characterized by strong winds, storms, and large cloud formations, including the Great Dark Spot, a massive storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The planet has at least 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most notable due to its retrograde orbit and geysers that spew nitrogen gas. Neptune takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun and has a very cold environment, with average temperatures around -214 degrees Celsius (-353 degrees Fahrenheit). The planet was discovered in 1846 through mathematical predictions based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit, making it the first planet found through such calculations.  </p>
